# Dell Pro AI Studio (`dpais`) CLI

## Overview

The Dell Pro AI Studio (`dpais`) CLI is a powerful command-line tool designed to manage and run AI models locally on your Dell hardware. It automates the setup of necessary services, intelligently filters models based on your system's hardware (CPU, GPU, NPU), and provides a simple interface for installing, running, and managing a catalog of curated AI models.

> **Pre-release Software**
> Please note this is a dev build and is pre-release.

**Key Features:**

*   **Automated Setup:** A single `init` command installs core services, dependencies, and AI models.
*   **Hardware-Aware:** Automatically detects your system's architecture (x64/ARM64) and compute devices (CPU, NPU, GPU) to show and install compatible models.
*   **Diverse Model Catalog:** Supports various model types including Large Language Models (LLMs), Transcription, Image Embedding, and Image Upscaling.
*   **Interactive Chat:** Run and interact with LLMs directly in your terminal.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Test the performance of installed models on your hardware.
*   **Service Management:** Easily check the status of and restart the underlying AI runtime service.

## Getting Started: Installation and Initial Setup

The `init` command is the starting point. It prepares your system by installing all required dependencies, core services, and then guides you through installing your first AI models.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Windows Operating System
*   Administrator privileges (the CLI will prompt for elevation if needed)
*   An active internet connection

### Install here:

```bash
winget install Dell.DPAIS
```

### Run the `init` command

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
dpais init
```

This command will:

1.  **Check for Administrator Privileges:** If not running as an administrator, the CLI will prompt you to relaunch with elevated permissions.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** It uses `winget` to automatically install required runtimes like .NET 8 and the VC++ Redistributable. You can skip this with the `--skip-deps` flag.
    > **Important Dependency Note**
    > Please note that your .NET Core and Desktop runtimes **must be the same version**. The CLI handles this, but if you are installing dependencies manually, be aware of this requirement.
3.  **Install Core Services:** Downloads and installs the core "Dell AI Framework" and "DellTechHub" service, which manage the AI models in the background.
4.  **Install Models:** After the core services are installed, it will present a list of compatible models for you to install.

### Installation for Core Services Only

If you only want to install the background services without being prompted to install models immediately, use the `--core` flag:

```bash
dpais init --core
```

You can then install models later using the `dpais model install` command.

***

## Core Commands

These commands help you manage the DPAIS environment and view system information.

### `compute` (or `hardware`)

Displays a list of AI-capable compute devices (CPU, GPU, NPU) detected on your system. This is useful for understanding which models will be available for you to install.

```bash
dpais compute
```

### `ping`

Checks the status of the DPAIS runtime service (`DellTechHub`). This is the quickest way to see if the AI backend is ready.

```bash
dpais ping
```

### `restart`

Restarts the DPAIS runtime service. This is useful if the service becomes unresponsive or after installing new models to ensure they are loaded correctly.

```bash
dpais restart
```

***

## Managing Models (`dpais model`)

The `model` command is the primary way you will interact with the AI models themselves.

### `model list` (or `ls`)

Lists the AI models available for your system, indicating which are already installed.

*   **To see a list of compatible models for your system:**
    ```bash
    dpais model list
    ```
*   **To see a more detailed view:**
    ```bash
    dpais model list --verbose
    ```
*   **To see the entire model catalog:**
    ```bash
    dpais model list all
    ```

### `model install`

Downloads and installs one or more AI models.

*   **Launch an interactive selection prompt:**
    ```bash
    dpais model install
    ```
*   **Install a specific model directly by name:**
    ```bash
    dpais model install --model "Phi-3.5-mini-instruct"
    ```

### `model run` (or `chat`)

Starts an interactive chat session with an installed Large Language Model (LLM).

*   **To choose from installed LLMs:**
    ```bash
    dpais model run
    ```
*   **To run a specific LLM:**
    ```bash
    dpais model run --model phi3.5
    ```
*   **To start a chat with a custom system prompt:**
    ```bash
    dpais model run --model phi3.5 --system "You are a pirate."
    ```
    Type `exit` to end the chat session.

### `model performance`

Runs a benchmark test on an installed model to measure its performance on your hardware.

```bash
dpais model performance --model whisper
```

If the model option is not provided, it will prompt you to choose one. The output includes metrics like load time, average execution time, and (for LLMs) tokens per second.

### `model uninstall`

Uninstalls one or more AI models from your system.

*   **To launch an interactive selection prompt:**
    ```bash
    dpais model uninstall
    ```
*   **To uninstall a specific model:**
    ```bash
    dpais model uninstall --model phi3.5
    ```
*   **To uninstall all currently installed models:**
    ```bash
    dpais model uninstall --model -all
    ```

***

## Complete Uninstallation

The `uninstall` command removes the Dell Pro AI Studio Framework and, optionally, all models and related Dell services.

*   **To uninstall all models and the Dell AI Framework:**
    ```bash
    dpais uninstall
    ```
*   **To also uninstall the Dell Core Services (`DellTechHub`):**
    ```bash
    dpais uninstall --dcs
    ```
*   **To leave models untouched and only remove the Dell AI Framework:**
    ```bash
    dpais uninstall --skip-model-uninstall
    ```
